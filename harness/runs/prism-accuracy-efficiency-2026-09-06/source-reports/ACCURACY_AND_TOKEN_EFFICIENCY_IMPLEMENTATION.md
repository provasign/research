# Accuracy and Token Efficiency: Implementation Checkpoint

Date: 2026-09-06

Status: First implementation milestone applied to the working checkouts:
Prism `cand-search-context` and research `main`. Uncommitted and not released.
The proposal's product-level accuracy and cost targets have NOT been demonstrated.

Companion: [original proposal](ACCURACY_AND_TOKEN_EFFICIENCY_PROPOSAL.md).

## 1. Deliverables and Isolation

Prism base: `a1c7aa6`. Research base: `b6956ef22b3c0eee88eda1ed2ecef594c2d4c1a8`.

- [Prism patch](accuracy-efficiency-candidate/prism.patch): seven source/test files.
- [Research harness patch](accuracy-efficiency-candidate/research.patch): seven source/test files.
- [Impact and completeness checks](accuracy-efficiency-candidate/impact-checks.txt).
- [Validation summary](accuracy-efficiency-candidate/validation.json).
- Prism working copy: `/Users/tapabratapal/Projects/provasign/prism`.
- Harness working copy: `/Users/tapabratapal/Projects/provasign/research`.
- Original isolated copies remain under `/private/tmp/prism-improvement.s40slA/`.
- Candidate binary: `/private/tmp/prism-improvement.s40slA/prism-candidate`.

Candidate binary SHA-256:
`0d6c0e9048b6a07c592bcb4c35d42720354b52965417e7cf57c33c94081cdaa2`.

After the user confirmed Claude was finished, both patches were applied to the
working checkouts without conflicts. Existing instruction/config edits,
`harness/mason_bench.py` changes, benchmark artifacts, and shared corpus checkouts
were preserved. The installed Prism binary was not replaced. No paid agent
benchmark was launched. No commit, tag, or push was made.

The patches preserve the context=2 default and earlier exhaustive-search fixes
already present in the Prism base, and build on the measurement changes already
present in the research base. Those earlier changes are not attributed to this
implementation.

## 2. Search Correctness

Implemented:

- Every search response identifies the actual repository root, once per batch.
- Mixed symbol/text searches retain BOTH passes' truncation state. Text timeouts
  and rejected paths survive even when the text pass returned zero hits.
- Incomplete, failed, rejected-scope, and term-capped searches no longer receive
  the global all-empty completion guidance.
- Omitted query terms are listed explicitly as not searched.
- Complete-empty guidance limits its statement to the requested scope and says
  excluded files and unindexed symbols are not covered.
- Symbol fetch growth stops at the configured work bound without overshooting
  it or overflowing a caller-supplied limit.
- Reaching a scan bound without knowing the remaining in-scope count reports
  that the count is unknown, rather than inventing a lower bound.
- Invalid search scopes return an error. Excessive positive result limits are
  clamped with a note.
- Root and partial-result warnings survive repeated-response note compression.

Why this matters: a short result is only a win when an agent can distinguish
a complete result from a partial one. An authoritative-looking partial result
can lower cost by making the agent stop too early, which is not product success.

Not implemented here: a full index-freshness contract, exhaustive pagination,
a byte/token budget over the whole serialized batch, or complete graph-edge
resolution. The existing 2,000-symbol exhaustive cap still exists and is stated.
This milestone does not make an arbitrary exhaustive request unbounded.

## 3. Context Delivery

The CLI search command now uses the existing MCP merged renderer directly,
avoiding the old CLI's repeated paths and overlapping context blocks.
Explicit `--context 0` is passed through instead of silently falling back to
the new default of two context lines. Invalid context arguments fail clearly.

A deterministic regression fixture preserves the same path, line numbers,
matched text, and surrounding source:

| Renderer | UTF-8 bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| Legacy CLI renderer | 581 |
| Shared merged renderer | 118 |

That is **79.7% fewer output bytes on this fixture**. It is not a measured
79.7% token saving, nor an estimate of whole-session savings. Search root and
completeness metadata intentionally add some bytes on other result shapes.

The mechanism is tested; the behavioral hypothesis still needs a model study:
does immediate, non-repeated source context actually displace later host Reads
and shorten successful tasks?

## 4. Measurement Integrity

### Usage Accounting

- Claude uncached input, cache creation, cache reads, and output are retained
  separately. Request-input totals include all three input categories.
- Missing, negative, non-finite, or invalid counters/costs remain unknown.
- The final CLI result supplies aggregate output usage and CLI-reported cost.
  Its cost is a client-side estimate, not authoritative provider billing.
- Transcript assistant messages are deduplicated by message ID. Later streamed
  usage updates replace earlier counters rather than adding duplicate copies.
- Tool calls/results are attributed by tool-use ID, with UTF-8 byte counting.
- Transcript step output is kept as an observation, not silently substituted for
  authoritative final output. Missing identity or usage is flagged.
- Mode-A cells retain raw CLI results, normalized usage, parsed answers, and
  explicit measurement/provider-error status.

### Read-After-Locate Diagnostic

- Classification is frozen before a read receives its own result.
- Repeated stream events are not counted as additional reads or turns.
- Delivered search context is recognized alongside query/lookup/read windows.
- A partial source window cannot prove that an unbounded whole-file read was
  redundant.
- Edits and compaction invalidate old source coverage. Bash conservatively
  invalidates prior coverage because its mutations are not fully observable.
- File matching uses path-component boundaries and rejects ambiguous matches.
- Legacy transcript fingerprint lookup accepts only a unique match.

This remains a diagnostic based on rendered text, not a provider billing
attribution system. Structured provenance and file-version identities are still
needed to replace heuristics. Conservative invalidation can undercount redundant
reads; that is preferable to manufacturing a token-saving explanation.

### Haiku Release Gate

- MCP config files are process-local rather than shared fixed filenames.
- Each cell attempt archives its pinned corpus into a fresh Git repository and
  indexes that snapshot. It never checks out or indexes the shared corpus.
- Cache identity includes the task/ground truth, resolved corpus commit, model
  argument, CLI version, binary SHA-256, steering, config, and relevant source
  hashes.
- Actual attempts are written to uniquely named, immutable evidence files before
  updating the canonical record. Degenerate attempts are preserved too.
- Candidate retries require a fresh cell. All recorded attempt costs and
  request-input tokens contribute to the comparison.
- Missing usage, failed baselines, missing corpora, or incomplete scored pairs
  produce a harness error instead of PASS.
- The gate explicitly states that candidate-only quality retries are an
  operational rule, not a significance test.

The gate still compares released Prism with candidate Prism, not native tools.
Its final-attempt quality selection, small sample size, model aliases, and
cheapest-first fail-fast ordering make it unsuitable for proving product
superiority. Retaining attempts makes selection visible; it does not remove it.

## 5. Verification Performed

All checks below were run against the isolated changes:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Full Go suite, `go test ./... -count=1` | Pass |
| Changed packages, `go test ./internal/mcp ./internal/cli -race -count=1` | Pass |
| Harness `pytest harness/tests` | 44 passed |
| `git diff --check`, both checkouts | Pass |
| `prism verify --base HEAD --format text`, both checkouts | No missed sites; 7 changed files each |
| Candidate CLI vs `rg -F`, exact file/line/text equality | Pass |

The CLI parity probe used the same root and `harness/ab_gate.py` in both tools:

| Query | rg hits | Candidate hits |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| MEAN_RECALL_DROP | 3 | 3 |
| require-cheaper | 4 | 4 |
| not-broken | 1 | 1 |

This establishes parity for these inputs, not universal search correctness.
Prism verification checks diff coverage, not behavioral correctness; it
supplements, rather than replaces, tests. Python impact lookup returned broad
name-collision sets in some cases, so it was not treated as proof of exact
cross-module resolution.

To rerun the free checks:

```sh
cd /private/tmp/prism-improvement.s40slA/prism
GOFLAGS= GOWORK=off go test ./... -count=1
go test ./internal/mcp ./internal/cli -race -count=1

cd /private/tmp/prism-improvement.s40slA/research
python3 -B -m pytest -p no:asyncio -p no:pytest_asyncio harness/tests -q

python3 -B /private/tmp/prism-improvement.s40slA/search_probe.py
```

## 6. Remaining Work and Acceptance

This is an implemented foundation, not the whole proposal. The next milestones
remain gated:

1. Review and commit the integrated changes. The working-tree integration is
   complete; the product goals below are not. Provasign intent/check tooling
   and its CLI are unavailable in this environment, so no certified admission
   or commit was performed.
2. Extend the response contract with source freshness, version-bound reusable
   evidence, bounded whole-response delivery, and actionable continuation.
3. Add task-specific semantic validation to wide changes. Touching the right
   files/regions or compiling does not establish behavioral correctness.
4. Run a budget-capped, isolated native/released/candidate pilot with the same
   pinned model, task inputs, native-tool access, and comparable prompts.
   Randomize/balance arm order, preserve all trials, and separate infrastructure
   retries from quality outcomes. Disable cross-trial cache reuse for estimation.
5. Analyze per-task verified success, required-site recall, false-complete rate,
   full input/output tokens, reported dollar cost, and follow-up reads.
   Keep easy/hard task strata visible and use paired uncertainty estimates.
6. Expand to a held-out confirmation set before release/product claims.

The proposal's targets remain targets: at least 30% lower aggregate reported
model cost and 25% fewer total tokens, without sacrificing required-site recall,
and better verified completion on hard tasks than a competent native-tools
baseline. Neither a smaller fixture nor a passing Haiku release gate meets
those acceptance criteria.

The larger three-arm study remains pending. The user subsequently authorized
the narrow four-way pilot documented in section 10; its result is local
evidence, not confirmation of the product-wide acceptance targets.

## 7. Working-Tree Integration

Both checkouts were still at the recorded base commits when integration began;
neither patch overlapped existing edits. The complete Go suite and all 44
harness tests were rerun successfully on the working checkouts. Race checks
for the MCP and CLI packages also passed with `GOFLAGS= GOWORK=off`. Both
`git diff --check` runs passed. Prism completeness checks reported no missed
sites across 19 changed Prism files and eight research files; those counts
include pre-existing user changes, not just this implementation.

New source/test files are marked intent-to-add so diff checks include them;
their contents have not been staged. The earlier isolated-checkout evidence
and patch artifacts remain available above.

## 8. Analyzer Review Follow-Up

Claude's review identified two reproduced diagnostic problems and one unproven
compatibility concern. The fixes are applied to the research working tree,
still uncommitted. The updated harness suite has **49 passing tests**;
`git diff --check` and `prism verify` pass. No paid run was needed.

- Session transcripts normally have no CLI stdout `result` event. The analyzer
  now reports `aggregate_status=not_present_in_transcript`,
  `usage_complete=null`, and separate `diagnostics_complete`. It retains unknown
  aggregate output instead of promoting per-step placeholders, without labeling
  valid transcript diagnostics as erroneous. The CLI gate's usage check remains
  a boolean and is unchanged.
- Bash no longer asserts that every file was edited. It invalidates coverage
  conservatively and reports freshness as unknown. Successful Edit/Write
  results establish edits; failed edit attempts do not. An independent
  `located_then_read` metric retains the location signal regardless of freshness.
  Shell scripts may alter paths absent from their command line, and today's
  filesystem mtimes cannot reconstruct historical changes.
- All four aggregate token fields were present in **100 saved raw CLI usage
  records** across three benchmark families. Another 411 inspected records did
  not retain raw usage, so they cannot establish key presence. No zero-cache
  aggregate was found in this sample: omission-at-zero remains unproven, not
  ruled out for every CLI version. A new regression test accepts explicit zero
  cache counters while keeping missing counters unknown; the strict rule was
  not weakened on speculation.

Replay of the two transcripts cited in the review:

| Cell | Located reads, before -> after | Confirmed rereads after | Unknown freshness after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| grove b40b72d94e, v0.71.1 | 4 -> 8 | 2 | 4 |
| prism 98ed1b2b4d, v0.71.1 | 1 -> 10 | 14 | 10 |

Both now have valid diagnostics and no missing-aggregate warning. Input totals
and unique-message counts remain unchanged (65 and 194). None of the uncertain
reads is credited as redundant. See [before/after evidence](accuracy-efficiency-candidate/analyzer-review.json).

The source distinction follows the [Claude SDK usage documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/cost-tracking):
per-step output counters may be placeholders; final output comes from the
result. That documentation also distinguishes SDK/CLI cost estimates from
provider billing. The benchmark objective is lower reported model cost, not a
claim that these local estimates have been reconciled to an invoice.

## 9. Per-Invocation Accounting

The initial `attempt_total` behavior was cumulative across every stored attempt
under a manifest. That is retained for historical auditing only; it is no
longer the gate's primary cost picture or efficiency-comparison numerator.

Each invocation now has a unique ID and a record in `out/invocations/`.
It records newly incurred cost and tokens, including current-run retries,
after each attempt and on fail-fast/error exits. Cached cells explicitly show
`reused` and zero new spend. Unknown aggregate usage remains unknown, including
an agent timeout that returns no final usage. Repeated visits to the same
attempt do not duplicate spend.

Efficiency comparisons use the attempts belonging to each selected measurement's
originating invocation, labeled separately from newly incurred spend. Thus a
cached baseline is not treated as a zero-cost answer, and an earlier invocation's
attempts do not inflate a fresh candidate measurement. `--fresh` reruns both
arms for a new pair. Legacy measurements without an invocation identity cannot
silently count as known zero-cost measurements.

Validation: **54 harness tests pass**, including separate-invocation resets,
cached zero-new-spend behavior, retry inclusion, historical unknown-cost
isolation, failure-path persistence, and a regression in which a candidate's
$100 historical spend cannot change a new $0.50 vs $1.00 comparison.
`git diff --check` and the research `prism verify` pass. These changes remain
uncommitted and do not alter the four-way experiment's raw records.

## 10. Four-Way Pilot

On one 22-site Jackson impact task, Sonnet native found 18 sites and Sonnet
with current Prism found all 22, using 79.0% fewer reported tokens and 62.4%
less estimated model cost. Both Codex cells found all 22; the properly configured
Prism cell used 68.5% fewer tokens and 59.3% less estimated cost.

One Codex MCP-permission setup failure required a replacement execution.
Its cost is retained: all five attempts total $2.3848 estimated model cost.
Charging that setup failure makes Codex + Prism more expensive in this
experiment, even though its corrected cell was cheaper. This was not a
quality-based retry. Claude auxiliary usage is included in audited token totals.

See the [four-way report](accuracy-efficiency-candidate/four-way-2026-09-06/REPORT.md)
for the per-cell table, cost definitions, raw evidence, cache/host limitations,
and why this does not establish an old/new Prism improvement or broad superiority.

## 11. Three-Task Four-Way Panel

The authorized 24-cell panel completed for $4.0132298 estimated model cost,
including every execution in this invocation and none from the earlier pilot.
Three tasks, two repeats, and four arms were frozen before outcomes. No
candidate changes or selective reruns occurred during the panel.

The result is **inconclusive, not a readiness pass**: one Sonnet treatment
execution never used its available Prism tools, leaving 23 arm-valid cells.
That is treatment non-use, not an MCP setup failure. Its $0.024814 cost and
correct answer remain visible but cannot be credited to Prism delivery.

All 11 valid Prism executions achieved full recall and precision. Native
Sonnet missed one TypeORM site while claiming completeness. TypeORM token
savings across two repeats were 79.2% for Sonnet and 36.1% for Codex. However,
Codex used 68.0% more tokens on Gin and 90.1% more on Django. Its six valid
pairs fail both efficiency thresholds: median paired token saving -54.0%
(target +25%) and summed estimated cost saving 19.2% (target 30%).

The next targets are evidence-backed reduction of repeated verification,
cheaper simple-task delivery, clearer parameter contracts, and an explicit
non-use measurement policy. The experiment supports pursuing those targets,
not declaring the product goal achieved. See the [report and all raw cells](accuracy-efficiency-candidate/panel-2026-09-06/REPORT.md).
All 24 saved answers and usage totals were independently replayed; 11 new
offline audit/analysis tests pass. Existing implementation checks above remain
separate from this model experiment. No product code changed during the panel.

## 12. Evidence Delivery And Batched Reads

A subsequent candidate addresses the panel's repeated reads and simple-task
overhead: impact text retains signatures/test labels and adds bounded matching
call expressions; lookup can fetch up to ten named methods together. Heuristic
receiver uncertainty, missing evidence, oversized batches, and lookup errors
stay explicit. No impact sites are removed, and no later verification call is
blocked. This step does not modify the frozen 24-cell panel.

Free pinned-corpus probes preserve every ordered impact site in Gin, Django,
and TypeORM. Django now supplies all seven caller expressions, and TypeORM all
25 callers have source evidence. Gin's three scalar lookup bodies are reproduced
by one batch. The responses are larger, so these checks establish evidence
preservation and fewer possible tool calls, not lower autonomous-session tokens.

Seven new Go tests and the final full race-enabled suite pass. Model spend for
this step is zero. The paid before/after comparison remains pending approval.
See the [candidate, bounds, raw probes, and measurement protocol](accuracy-efficiency-candidate/evidence-delivery-2026-09-06/README.md).

## 13. Codex Before/After Measurement

The user subsequently authorized the eight-cell comparison of the frozen
panel Prism binary against the evidence-delivery candidate: Gin and Django,
two repeats each, Codex GPT-5.5 at medium effort. All eight executions were
arm-valid and achieved full recall and precision. Every candidate pair used
fewer tokens and cost less, but the preset efficiency bar was not met:
15.3% median paired token saving versus a 25% target, and 27.7% aggregate
estimated cost saving versus 30%. Aggregate token saving was 28.9%; it does
not substitute for the task-balanced median criterion.

Current-invocation spend was $1.206159 estimated, with no setup failures,
timeouts, non-use cells, or retries. The raw answers and usage of all eight
executions replay exactly, and six offline comparison tests pass. No product
code or experimental rules changed during execution.

Batched lookup was adopted in both Gin repeats; Django post-impact lookups
fell to zero in both repeats. Post-impact searches persisted, and the candidate
incurred one unsupported search-parameter error in each Gin repeat. The next
targets are task-aware first-tool selection, honest coverage reconciliation,
and parameter-contract clarity. This small old/new Prism study does not
establish superiority over native tools or validate Sonnet behavior.

See the [complete report and all eight executions](accuracy-efficiency-candidate/evidence-delivery-2026-09-06/comparison/REPORT.md).

## 14. Routing And Follow-up Measurement

The completed implementation/evidence was committed as `ebda175`, and the related
research harness changes as `552aa94`. Follow-up `e855442` added direct known-name
routing, explicit search-label support, stable bounded rollups, honest coverage
wording, and canonical scoped text paths. Nine new product tests and the full Go
race suite passed. Both previously failing Gin search requests replayed through
MCP with identical results with/without the label, at zero model spend.

The next authorized study held that new binary fixed and changed only the routing
paragraph: eight fresh Codex cells, Gin and Django, two repeats. Nine new runner
tests, six existing analyzer tests, and an eight-cell model-free dry run passed
before launch. All eight model executions were valid, with 100% recall/precision
and no false-complete answers. The raw scoring and usage replayed exactly.

Results: 338,682 -> 288,583 tokens (14.8% aggregate saving), $0.595794 -> $0.468060
estimated arm cost (21.4% saving), and 11.1% median paired token saving. Both preset
efficiency targets still fail. This invocation spent $1.063854; no retries, setup
failures, non-use, or unknown usage were excluded. One ordinary lookup argument
error is included. No product source or frozen experimental rule changed mid-run.

Searches after impact fell 4 -> 0 and native rescans 2 -> 0, but post-impact
lookups remained 7 -> 7. Across two repeats, Gin saved 31.1% of tokens; Django used
15.5% more tokens despite costing 13.5% less. Fewer tool calls do not establish
fewer model requests or lower token usage. The next implementation hypothesis is
per-item file-scoped batch lookup, preserving explicit ambiguity and omission,
so identical backend method names can be read together across files.

This is guidance-only evidence, not a native-control comparison. Do not compound
its percentages with the earlier binary comparison or claim broad savings.
See the [new report, protocol, and raw evidence](accuracy-efficiency-candidate/routing-2026-09-06/comparison/REPORT.md).
